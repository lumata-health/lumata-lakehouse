# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a focused Salesforce data pipeline using dbtHub for ingestion and dbt Core for transformation. The system will extract sf_user data from Salesforce using dbtHub as the ingestion framework, transform it using dbt Core, and implement Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD) Type 2 to track historical changes in Division and Audit_Phase__c fields. The primary goals are simplicity, efficiency, and comprehensive historical tracking of user data changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: dbtHub-Based Data Ingestion

**User Story:** As a data engineer, I want to use dbtHub as the ingestion framework to extract sf_user data from Salesforce, so that I can leverage a modern, declarative approach to data ingestion with built-in monitoring and error handling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Salesforce data needs to be extracted THEN the system SHALL use dbtHub to extract sf_user data from Salesforce API
2. WHEN the extraction process runs THEN the system SHALL configure dbtHub to handle Salesforce authentication and API rate limiting automatically
3. WHEN data is extracted THEN the system SHALL write sf_user data to raw Iceberg tables with proper schema detection and evolution
4. WHEN extraction completes THEN the system SHALL trigger downstream dbt transformations automatically
5. WHEN extraction fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logging through dbtHub's monitoring capabilities

### Requirement 2: Native Iceberg Table Support

**User Story:** As a data architect, I want all data stored in Apache Iceberg format, so that I can leverage ACID transactions, schema evolution, time travel, and efficient incremental processing capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN raw data is written THEN the system SHALL store all Salesforce objects as Iceberg tables with proper partitioning strategies
2. WHEN schema changes occur in Salesforce THEN the system SHALL automatically handle schema evolution without breaking downstream processes
3. WHEN data updates are processed THEN the system SHALL use Iceberg's native merge capabilities for efficient upserts and deletes
4. WHEN historical analysis is needed THEN the system SHALL support time travel queries to access data at any point in time
5. WHEN data consistency is required THEN the system SHALL leverage Iceberg's ACID transaction guarantees

### Requirement 3: dbt Core Transformations

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want all data transformations to be written in SQL using dbt Core, so that I can easily understand, maintain, and extend the sf_user data pipeline logic without complex programming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN transformations are needed THEN the system SHALL use dbt Core models to process sf_user Iceberg tables
2. WHEN incremental processing is required THEN the system SHALL use dbt's incremental materialization strategies with Iceberg's merge capabilities for sf_user data
3. WHEN data quality is important THEN the system SHALL include dbt tests specifically for sf_user data validation and quality assurance
4. WHEN documentation is needed THEN the system SHALL automatically generate data lineage and documentation for sf_user transformations through dbt
5. WHEN transformations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and rollback capabilities for sf_user processing

### Requirement 4: SCD Type 2 Implementation for sf_user

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to track historical changes to sf_user records using SCD Type 2, specifically monitoring changes to Division and Audit_Phase__c fields, so that I can analyze how user assignments and audit phases have evolved over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sf_user records change in Salesforce THEN the system SHALL implement SCD Type 2 with update_date, is_current, and is_deleted flags
2. WHEN Division or Audit_Phase__c fields are updated THEN the system SHALL close the previous version (set is_current=false) and create a new current version with update_date timestamp
3. WHEN a sf_user record is deleted in Salesforce THEN the system SHALL mark it as deleted (is_deleted=true) while preserving all historical data
4. WHEN querying current sf_user data THEN the system SHALL provide easy access to current records via is_current=true filter
5. WHEN analyzing user history THEN the system SHALL support tracking changes specifically for Division and Audit_Phase__c fields over time

### Requirement 5: sf_user Data Quality and Validation

**User Story:** As a data steward, I want comprehensive data quality validation for sf_user records, so that I can ensure the accuracy and completeness of user data used for organizational analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sf_user data is processed THEN the system SHALL validate required fields including Id, Name, Division, and Audit_Phase__c
2. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information and continue processing valid records
3. WHEN Division values are processed THEN the system SHALL validate against expected organizational divisions
4. WHEN Audit_Phase__c values are processed THEN the system SHALL validate against expected audit phase values
5. WHEN data profiling is needed THEN the system SHALL provide statistics on Division and Audit_Phase__c value distributions

### Requirement 6: Incremental Processing and Performance for sf_user

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the sf_user data pipeline to process only changed records and complete within acceptable time windows, so that I can minimize costs and ensure timely data availability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN incremental loads run THEN the system SHALL process only sf_user records modified since the last successful run based on LastModifiedDate
2. WHEN sf_user data is processed THEN the system SHALL complete extraction and transformation within 30 minutes for typical volumes
3. WHEN dbtHub ingestion occurs THEN the system SHALL handle Salesforce API rate limiting automatically without manual intervention
4. WHEN query performance is measured THEN the system SHALL provide sub-second response times for sf_user analytical queries
5. WHEN storage costs are evaluated THEN the system SHALL optimize sf_user Iceberg table layouts and compaction for cost efficiency

### Requirement 7: Pipeline Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want comprehensive monitoring and observability for the sf_user pipeline, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues while maintaining data pipeline reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN dbtHub ingestion runs THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging and metrics for sf_user extraction
2. WHEN dbt transformations execute THEN the system SHALL track model execution times and success rates
3. WHEN SCD processing occurs THEN the system SHALL monitor the number of new, updated, and deleted sf_user records
4. WHEN data quality issues are detected THEN the system SHALL send alerts with specific details about sf_user data problems
5. WHEN debugging is required THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed logs with correlation IDs for tracing sf_user data flow

### Requirement 8: Security and Access Control

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want proper security controls for sf_user data access, so that we maintain data privacy and comply with organizational security policies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sf_user data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt all data at rest using appropriate encryption methods
2. WHEN Salesforce API communication occurs THEN the system SHALL use secure authentication and TLS encryption
3. WHEN data access is granted THEN the system SHALL implement role-based access control for sf_user tables
4. WHEN audit trails are required THEN the system SHALL log all sf_user data access and modification activities
5. WHEN sensitive fields are processed THEN the system SHALL handle Division and Audit_Phase__c data according to organizational policies
