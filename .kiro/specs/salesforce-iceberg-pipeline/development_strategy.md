# Development Strategy and Workflow

## Recommended Approach: Develop in Current Repo First

Based on your excellent suggestion, here's the optimal development strategy:

## Phase 1: Setup Development Environment

### Create Redesign Folder in Current Repo

```bash
# Navigate to your current lumata-datalake repo
cd lumata-datalake

# Create redesign subfolder
mkdir redesign
cd redesign

# Create complete project structure
mkdir -p {infrastructure/cloudformation,glue-jobs/utils,dbt-project/{models/{staging,intermediate,marts},macros,tests},scripts,config,docs}

# Initialize with README
cat > README.md << 'EOF'
# Lumata Lakehouse Redesign

This folder contains the redesigned Salesforce data pipeline using:
- AWS Glue (Python) for data extraction
- Apache Iceberg for storage
- dbt (SQL) for transformations
- CloudFormation (JSON) for infrastructure

## Development Status
- [ ] Infrastructure setup
- [ ] Glue jobs development
- [ ] dbt models creation
- [ ] Testing and validation
- [ ] Migration to lumata-lakehouse repo

# Track in git
git add redesign/
git commit -m "Initialize redesign project structure"
```

## Phase 2: Development Benefits

### Why This Approach is Optimal

#### **For AI Assistant (Me)**
- ✅ **Complete Context**: Can see both old and new implementations
- ✅ **Easy Comparisons**: Compare configurations, data models, business logic
- ✅ **Migration Guidance**: Understand exactly what needs to change
- ✅ **Validation Support**: Help compare outputs between systems
- ✅ **Troubleshooting**: Reference working old system when issues arise

#### **For You and Your Team**
- ✅ **Risk Mitigation**: Old system keeps running during development
- ✅ **Parallel Development**: Build new while maintaining current operations
- ✅ **Easy Validation**: Compare data quality and results
- ✅ **Knowledge Transfer**: Team can see both approaches side by side
- ✅ **Rollback Safety**: Always have working fallback

#### **For Development Process**
- ✅ **Incremental Migration**: Move components one by one
- ✅ **Data Validation**: Run both systems in parallel for comparison
- ✅ **Performance Testing**: Compare speed and efficiency
- ✅ **Business Continuity**: No disruption to current operations

## Phase 3: Development Workflow

### Step 1: Infrastructure Development
```bash
cd lumata-datalake/redesign/infrastructure

# Create CloudFormation templates
# Test deployment in dev environment
# Compare with existing infrastructure
```

### Step 2: Glue Jobs Development
```bash
cd lumata-datalake/redesign/glue-jobs

# Develop Salesforce extractor
# Test with small data sets
# Compare output with current system
```

### Step 3: dbt Development
```bash
cd lumata-datalake/redesign/dbt-project

# Create staging models
# Develop transformations
# Validate data quality
```

### Step 4: Parallel Testing
```bash
# Run both systems side by side
# Compare data outputs
# Validate business logic
# Performance benchmarking
```

## Phase 4: Migration Strategy

### When to Migrate to New Repo

**Migrate when:**
- ✅ All components developed and tested
- ✅ Data validation passes (>99% accuracy)
- ✅ Performance meets requirements
- ✅ Team trained on new system
- ✅ Documentation complete

### Migration Process

```bash
# 1. Create clean copy in new repo
cd lumata-lakehouse
cp -r ../lumata-datalake/redesign/* .

# 2. Update configurations for new repo
# 3. Test deployment in new environment
# 4. Update CI/CD pipelines
# 5. Update documentation

# 6. Archive old system
cd lumata-datalake
mkdir archive
mv [old-system-files] archive/
git add .
git commit -m "Archive old system, migration to lumata-lakehouse complete"
```

## Phase 5: Validation and Comparison

### Data Validation Scripts

Create scripts to compare old vs new systems:

```python
# scripts/compare_systems.py
def compare_record_counts():
    """Compare record counts between old and new systems"""
    # Old system query
    old_count = query_old_system("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sf_account")
    
    # New system query  
    new_count = query_new_system("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM dim_account WHERE is_current = true")
    
    return abs(old_count - new_count) < (old_count * 0.01)  # 1% tolerance

def compare_data_quality():
    """Compare data quality metrics"""
    # Compare null rates, duplicates, etc.
    pass

def compare_performance():
    """Compare processing times"""
    # Measure end-to-end pipeline execution
    pass
```

## Benefits Summary

### Short-term Benefits (During Development)
1. **Safe Development**: No risk to current operations
2. **Easy Debugging**: Reference working system when stuck
3. **Incremental Progress**: Build and test piece by piece
4. **Team Learning**: Understand both approaches

### Long-term Benefits (After Migration)
1. **Clean New Repo**: Fresh start with modern architecture
2. **Validated System**: Thoroughly tested before migration
3. **Team Confidence**: Proven system with known performance
4. **Documentation**: Complete understanding of both systems

## Recommended Timeline

### Week 1-2: Setup and Infrastructure
- Create redesign folder structure
- Develop CloudFormation templates
- Test basic infrastructure deployment

### Week 3-4: Core Development
- Develop Glue jobs
- Create dbt models
- Build orchestration

### Week 5: Testing and Validation
- Parallel system testing
- Data quality validation
- Performance comparison

### Week 6: Migration Preparation
- Prepare new repo
- Update documentation
- Team training

### Week 7: Migration and Cutover
- Migrate to lumata-lakehouse
- Production deployment
- Archive old system

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: safe development with complete context, and a clean final implementation in the new repository.
