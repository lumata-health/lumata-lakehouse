# SCD Type 2 Integrity and Currency Management Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of SCD Type 2 integrity and currency management for the sf_user dimension model. The implementation ensures proper handling of historical data, deleted records, and currency flags according to SCD Type 2 best practices.

## Requirements Satisfied

### Task 5.2: Implement SCD integrity and currency management

✅ **Add logic to mark previous versions as is_current=false when new versions are created**
- Implemented in `scd_merge_sf_user()` macro
- Automatically updates previous current records to `is_current=false`
- Ensures only one current record per user at any time

✅ **Implement proper handling of deleted sf_user records with is_deleted flag**
- Deleted records are marked with `is_deleted=true`
- Deleted records are never marked as current (`is_current=false`)
- Historical data is preserved for deleted users

✅ **Create unique SCD identifiers for tracking record versions**
- Generated using `dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key()`
- Includes user_id, update_date, division, audit_phase__c, and is_deleted
- Ensures uniqueness across all SCD record versions

## Key Implementation Features

### 1. Currency Management Logic

The SCD currency management ensures that:
- Each user has exactly one current record (excluding deleted records)
- Previous versions are automatically marked as `is_current=false`
- Deleted records are never considered current

```sql
-- Currency logic in scd_type2_sf_user.sql
case
    when is_deleted = true then false  -- Deleted records are never current
    when is_latest_version = true and is_deleted = false then true  -- Latest non-deleted version is current
    else false  -- All other versions are not current
end as is_current
```

### 2. Deleted Record Handling

Proper handling of deleted sf_user records:
- `is_deleted=true` for records where `isdeleted=true` in source
- Deleted records maintain `is_current=false`
- Historical data is preserved for audit purposes
- Deleted records are excluded from current data queries

### 3. Unique SCD Identifiers

SCD identifiers are generated to ensure uniqueness:
```sql
{{ dbt_utils.generate_surrogate_key(['user_id', 'update_date', 'division', 'audit_phase__c', 'is_deleted']) }} as _scd_id
```

This ensures each version has a unique identifier for:
- Merge operations in incremental processing
- Version tracking and debugging
- Data lineage and audit trails

### 4. Version Sequence Tracking

Each SCD record includes a `version_sequence` field:
- Sequential numbering starting from 1 for each user
- Helps with debugging and data quality validation
- Enables easy identification of record progression

### 5. Incremental Processing Logic

The `scd_merge_sf_user()` macro handles incremental updates:

1. **Identify Updated Users**: Find users with new/changed records
2. **Generate New SCD Records**: Create new versions for changed tracked fields
3. **Update Previous Records**: Mark previous current records as `is_current=false`
4. **Merge Results**: Combine updated and new records

## Data Quality and Integrity Tests

### Comprehensive Integrity Validation

The implementation includes extensive testing in `test_scd_integrity_comprehensive.sql`:

1. **Multiple Current Records**: Ensures no user has multiple current records
2. **Missing Current Records**: Validates active users have current records
3. **Deleted Record Currency**: Confirms deleted records are not current
4. **SCD ID Uniqueness**: Validates unique SCD identifiers
5. **Version Continuity**: Checks for gaps in version sequences
6. **Currency Accuracy**: Ensures current records are the latest versions
7. **Change Validation**: Confirms SCD records only created for actual changes

### Built-in dbt Tests

Schema-level tests in `_schema.yml`:
- Unique constraints on `_scd_id` and `user_key`
- Not null validations on critical fields
- Business rule validations for Division and Audit_Phase__c
- SCD-specific integrity checks

## Performance Optimizations

### Iceberg Table Configuration

Optimized table properties for query performance:
```yaml
table_properties:
  'write.format.default': 'parquet'
  'write.parquet.compression-codec': 'snappy'
  'format-version': '2'  # Iceberg v2 for better performance
  'write.delete.mode': 'merge-on-read'
  'write.update.mode': 'merge-on-read'
```

### Partitioning Strategy

Partitioned by `is_current` and bucketed by `user_id`:
- Enables efficient current record queries
- Optimizes historical analysis queries
- Reduces scan costs for common query patterns

### Incremental Processing

Incremental predicates limit processing to changed records:
```sql
incremental_predicates: [
  "lastmodifieddate > (select coalesce(max(update_date), '1900-01-01'::timestamp) from {{ this }})"
]
```

## Usage Examples

### Query Current Records
```sql
SELECT user_id, name, division, audit_phase__c
FROM dim_sf_user_scd
WHERE is_current = true 
  AND is_deleted = false;
```

### Query Historical Changes
```sql
SELECT user_id, division, audit_phase__c, update_date, version_sequence
FROM dim_sf_user_scd
WHERE user_id = 'specific_user_id'
ORDER BY version_sequence;
```

### Analyze Division Changes Over Time
```sql
SELECT 
    division,
    count(*) as change_count,
    min(update_date) as first_change,
    max(update_date) as last_change
FROM dim_sf_user_scd
WHERE version_sequence > 1  -- Exclude initial records
GROUP BY division
ORDER BY change_count DESC;
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **SCD Integrity**: Number of integrity violations
2. **Processing Volume**: Records processed per run
3. **Change Rate**: Percentage of records with changes
4. **Currency Accuracy**: Validation of current flag accuracy

### Maintenance Tasks

1. **Regular Integrity Checks**: Run comprehensive tests weekly
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Track query performance on SCD table
3. **Data Quality Reviews**: Monitor Division/Audit_Phase__c value distributions
4. **Compaction**: Regular Iceberg table optimization

## Error Handling

The implementation includes robust error handling:
- Invalid Division/Audit_Phase__c values are filtered out
- Missing required fields cause record exclusion
- SCD integrity violations are logged and alerted
- Incremental processing failures trigger full refresh fallback

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. **Soft Deletes**: Enhanced handling of soft delete scenarios
2. **Bulk Processing**: Optimizations for large batch updates
3. **Real-time Processing**: Support for streaming SCD updates
4. **Advanced Analytics**: Pre-computed aggregations for common queries

This implementation provides a robust, scalable foundation for SCD Type 2 processing of sf_user data with comprehensive integrity management and performance optimization.
